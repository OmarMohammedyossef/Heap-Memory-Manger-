I'm thrilled to unveil the culmination of my efforts during the Advanced System Programming under Linux training at @STMicroelectronics:
Heap Memory Manager Project (HMM) for Dynamic Allocation in C, This training under the supervision of Eng.Reda Maherüéâ

Heap Memory Management*:
Introducing my Heap memory manager, featuring a bespoke implementation of the Heap memory manager library.
This project encompasses crucial functions such as malloc, free, calloc, and realloc, finely tuned to deliver optimal memory management performance.
Throughout the development journey, efficiency was at the forefront of my priorities. I meticulously optimized the codebase, 
strategically leveraging a doubly linked list data structure to minimize CPU usage and mitigate memory fragmentation issues, ensuring streamlined operation.
But the real test? Compatibility with essential Linux utilities.
 I'm proud to announce that my heap memory manager has been rigorously tested with all Linux utilities, including ls, grep, cat, mv, cp, and more.
 It seamlessly integrates with these utilities, demonstrating its reliability and versatility in diverse operating environments.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our mentor Eng Reda Maher, whose invaluable guidance has been instrumental in shaping this project and enriching our training experience.
üîç Here's a glimpse into the key features of our custom memory manager:
‚úÖ Dynamic Memory Allocation: Our system dynamically allocates memory blocks using the sbrk system call, catering to diverse application needs.
‚úÖ Fragmentation Prevention: By implementing advanced strategies like merging adjacent free memory blocks and optimizing memory splitting, significantly minimize memory fragmentation for enhanced system performance.
‚úÖ Seamless Integration: I've successfully integrated my custom memory manager with essential system commands and applications, ensuring compatibility and versatility across various software environments.
